Deliverables for part 2:
1.
2.
3.
4. Questions below:


1. If you enter a mileage, then it returns it, otherwise, it returns an empty string.
2. I would consider the new rule an event intermediary. It is potentially a
  preprocessing step, but in this case, it just passes mileage to the next
  event which handles it. This is an event stream splitting intermediary.
3. I can see from the longs that find_long_trips works because it tells me which
  queries were added to the pico queue and which were fired. For example,
  domain: 'explicit',
  type: 'trip_processed' },
  eci: 'cj0aahzsy0001g8en04btwid3' } not fired
  tells me that as per the conditional, the event was not fired when the trip
  was not long. In the other case, when the conditional is met, the logs
  indicate that the event was fired.
4. You could store long_trip as an entity variable.
