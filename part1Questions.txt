1. I used the engine ruleset validator to parse my rulesets in the browser.

2.
{
  "directives": [
    {
      "options": {
        "something": "Hello World"
      },
      "name": "say",
      "meta": {
        "rid": "echo",
        "rule_name": "hello",
        "txn_id": "TODO",
        "eid": "__testing"
      }
    }
  ]
}

  1 directive was returned.
  I think 1 rule ran.

  3.
